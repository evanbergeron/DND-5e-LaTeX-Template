# D&D 5e LaTeX Template

This is a prelimary attempt at a D&D 5e LaTeX template. The color scheme is close to the original source books, as are the fonts. The fonts chosen are included by default in TeX Live.

An example of a table with alternating row colors is given. It's a bit gross, however, and a lot could be done to clean that up.

The template compiles with pdflatex.
